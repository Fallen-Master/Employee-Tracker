  ## Description
This command-line application is designed to manage a company's employee database. It uses Inquirer 8.2.4 to interact with the user, enabling features like viewing, adding, and updating employee roles, salaries, and managers. This is a handy tool for business owners to keep their company organized.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```
npm i
```
  
## Usage
The application is not deployed since it's a command-line application. A walkthrough video demonstrates its functionality.[WalkThrough Video Link here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8J8ZlNm0LE8C2bk0xIwVCjXjeSreW4b/view?usp=sharing)
